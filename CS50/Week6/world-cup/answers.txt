Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations the highest winning rate in Spain is 40%. With an increase in the number of simulations, Spain's winning rate will drop to fourth place, at only 12.0%.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 sumulations.
