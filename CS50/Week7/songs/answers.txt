Someone's top 100 songs may indicate that they frequently listen to the top 10 songs. Therefore, we need to track the play count for their top 100 songs and calculate the weighted average for other statistical values. Additionally, we want to analyze the proportion of different artists in the top 100 songs. By considering each artist's style and calculating a weighted average, we can assess the overall musical style within the top 100 songs. This analysis provides insights into the user's listening preferences based on the artists and their styles.
